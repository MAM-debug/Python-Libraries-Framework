🌟 Simple Streamlit Practice App

This is a small Streamlit project I made while practicing how Streamlit works.
The goal was just to get comfortable with the basics — titles, text, widgets, and showing output based on user input.

🧠 What this app does

The app:

Shows headings, subheadings, and markdown text

Lets the user type their name

Lets the user pick their age using a slider

Shows a message based on what the user enters

Has a checkbox for “Do you like Streamlit?”

Gives a little response if checked

Just basic stuff — but perfect for starting out.
